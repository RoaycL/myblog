    ## Hello, world

    I'm thrilled to finally publish a dedicated space for long-form writing. This blog is where I'll share:

    - Notes from books and podcasts
    - Dev logs for side projects
    - Reflections on career and learning

    Expect a steady mix of technical walkthroughs and personal notes. I hope you'll find something useful and stick around for the journey.

    ## Overview

    Flask makes it straightforward to build APIs with minimal setup. Here's a tiny example:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, jsonify

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.get('/ping')
    def ping():
        return jsonify({"status": "ok"})
    ```

    When paired with a few well-placed tests and type hints, this pattern scales nicely for hobby projects.

    ## Tactics that work for me

    1. **Space repetition:** revisit material after a few days and again after a week.
    2. **Teach back:** write short summaries as if explaining to a peer.
    3. **Build something small:** a tiny project cements the new concept.

    I'll continue to share techniques that keep me consistent without burning out.
